Double entendres are somewhat common throughout song lyrics, but lines with three different meanings are harder to find. The only one I can think of off the top of my head is Tyler, the Creator's line on Frank Ocean's 2017 single [*Biking*][biking], in which he talks about the “*alcoholic way I \[he\] handle\[s\] the bars*”, bars here referring to either his rapping, the bike's handlebars or pubs. Earlier in the song Jay-Z has a somewhat similar line, “*handlebars like a Xanax*”, but I think the triple entendre there is a bit of a stretch.

[Here][rym] is an entire thread about triple entendres in music, with a bunch of other examples.
